# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

## Data Structures

This folder contains implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is organized into its own subfolder and may include multiple implementations in different programming languages.

### List of Data Structures

1. Binary Search Tree
2. Tree
3. Linked List
4. Graphs
   
**NOTICE:** Didn't cover easy data structures like Array, Stack, Queue, etc.

Feel free to explore each data structure's folder to find implementations in Python.

## Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of various algorithms in Python.

### List of Algorithms

**NOTICE:** Will be updated!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any implementations of data structures or algorithms that you'd like to add, feel free to submit a pull request.
