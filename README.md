# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

## Data Structures

This folder contains implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is organized into its own subfolder and may include multiple implementations in different programming languages.

### List of Data Structures

1. [Binary Search Tree](Data_Structures/)
2. [Tree](Data_Structures/tree.py)
3. [Linked List](Data_Structures/)

**NOTICE:** Will be updated!

Feel free to explore each data structure's folder to find implementations in your preferred programming language.

## Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of various algorithms. Each algorithm is organized into its own subfolder and may include multiple implementations in different programming languages.
